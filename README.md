# HeroDex
## A project for all nerdkind
This project will be an information providing web application. I would like to pull superhero data from a [free api source](https://superheroapi.com/try-now.html) and display it in a way that is easily digestable and fun for users. The final product will provide an interactive full stack web aplication for people who love sci-fi and want to know more about the characters.
### likely challenges
pulling information from an API comes with its challenges. However making a pleasing to the eye webpage is my weakness in this moment. As well as adding animation and moving elements will be challenging for me.
## Resources
Here is where I grabbed my [backgorund](https://pixabay.com/videos/tunnel-futuristic-scifi-sci-fi-27438/)
Here I will post up the resources i used to create the HeroDex.
In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znqUwx0b0HI) I learned how to use a video as my backgorund.

## Next steps
1. 9/25 
2. Add name to the top of the calling card
3. add functionality to back button and style so the button takes 100% of parent div
4. Soften edges of png
