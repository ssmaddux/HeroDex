# HeroDex
## A project for all nerdkind
This project will be an information providing web application. I would like to pull superhero data from a [free api source](https://superheroapi.com/try-now.html) and display it in a way that is easily digestable and fun for users. The final product will provide an interactive full stack web aplication for people who love sci-fi and want to know more about the characters.
### likely challenges
pulling information from an API comes with its challenges. However making a pleasing to the eye webpage is my weakness in this moment. As well as adding animation and moving elements will be challenging for me.
## Resources
Here is where I grabbed my [backgorund](https://pixabay.com/videos/tunnel-futuristic-scifi-sci-fi-27438/)
Here I will post up the resources i used to create the HeroDex.
In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znqUwx0b0HI) I learned how to use a video as my backgorund.
Grabbed glowing button from [here](https://codepen.io/Ks145/pen/MWGxbYr)
Grabbed the searchbar [here](https://freefrontend.com/css-search-boxes/)
## Next steps
1. 9/23 
2. Add functionality, when super is searched or selected the instructions from step one should dissapear as well as the search bar.
3. Add a back button that appears after step 5 and render all other info
4. *** ERROR *** error trying to acces the API. Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://superheroapi.com/api/--/search/3' from origin 'http://localhost:5500' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
